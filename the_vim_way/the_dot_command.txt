1. Add one level of indentation for each line.
Example:

    Line one
        Line two
            Line three
                Line four

Do it with the dot command:

Line one
Line two
Line three
Line four

2. Suppose that we have a Javascript snippet like the one bellow.
Add the missing semicolon to each line.

var foo = 'bar'
var bar = 'foo'
var foobar = foo + bar


3. Suppose that we have a line of code that looks like this.

    var foo = 'method('+argument1+', '+argument2+')';

Pad each + sign with spaces to make it look like this:

    var foo = 'method(' + argument1 + ', ' + argument2 + ')';

Go for it!

--> var foo = 'method('+argument1+', '+argument2+')';


4. In the next excerpt, the word "content appears on every line:
Substitute the word "content" with the word "copy" when it fits.

...We're waiting for content before the site can go live...
...If you are content with this, let's go ahead with it...
...We'll launch as soon as we have the content...
